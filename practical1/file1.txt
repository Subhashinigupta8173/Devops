🔹 Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)
- How it works:
- There is a single central repository (server).
- Developers connect to it via terminal and fetch/update code directly.
- Example: CVS, Subversion (SVN).
- Limitations:
- Single Point of Failure (SPOF): If the central server goes down, no one can commit or fetch code.
- Developers don’t have a full copy of the repo locally; they depend on the server.
🔹 Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)
- How it works:
- Every developer has a full copy of the repository (including history) on their local machine.
- Changes are made locally and then pushed to a shared remote repo (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
- Example: Git, Mercurial.
- Advantages:
- No SPOF — even if the server is down, developers can continue working locally.
- Faster operations (commits, diffs, logs happen locally).
- Easier branching and merging.

⚙️ Git Commands Cheat Sheet
🔹 Repository Setup
- git init → Initialize a new repository.
- git clone <repo-url> → Clone (download) the entire repository.
🔹 Remote Management
- git remote add origin <repo-url> → Add a remote repository named origin.
- git remote remove origin → Remove the remote origin.
- git remote -v → Show all remote URLs.
- git remote show origin → Show detailed info about the origin remote.
🔹 User Configuration
- git config --global user.name "Your Name" → Set global username.
- git config --global user.email "your@email.com" → Set global email.
🔹 Working with Files
- Files stay in the working directory until staged.
- git add . → Stage all changes (move to staging area).
- git commit -m "Commit message" → Commit changes locally.
- git push → Push commits to the remote repository (global level).

🌐 Data Fetch Methods in Git
- HTTP/HTTPS → Simple authentication via username/password or tokens.
- SSH → Secure authentication using SSH keys (preferred for security).
