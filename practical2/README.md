Question 1: Urgent Hotfix While Feature Work Is in Progress
Scenario:
You are actively working on a feature branch named feature/analytics-dashboard. Several files are modified, but the work is incomplete and cannot be committed yet. Suddenly, a critical bug is reported in production, and you are asked to immediately apply a hotfix on the main branch.
Problem:
You cannot switch branches because of uncommitted changes, and committing incomplete work is not allowed.
What should you do?
Explain how you would:
•	Temporarily save your ongoing work
•	Switch to main
•	Apply the hotfix
•	Resume feature development afterward
What the interviewer expects:
•	Understanding of temporary change management
•	Knowledge of safe branch switching
•	Correct handling of uncommitted work


here we also perfrom the concept of the stashing -when we have store the work temporarily
